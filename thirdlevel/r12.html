        <br>
    <div class="rbox"><p class="rbox_content">The Eagle in the Snow is a story about Barney, a boy whose house was destroyed by the German bombing of Coventry during World War 2. Leaving the ruins of Coventry behind on a train to London with his mother, Barney meets a stranger who has an incredible, dramatic and enthralling story to tell.
<br>
The stranger’s story is about a friend, a brave soldier fighting in World War 1, who makes a split second decision which will have consequences that he could never have imagined.
					<br>
The stranger tells Barney most of the story while they are stuck on the train in a tunnel because a German plane has attacked the train. The atmosphere in the train compartment is intense and the stranger’s story has lots of action and lots of twists. 
</p></div>

        <h2 class="r_questions">What did you particularly enjoy about this book?</h2>
        <div class="rbox"><p class="rbox_content">I like books with a lots of action and fighting like The Eagle in the Snow.  The plot of the book has many twists and I found that I couldn’t stop reading it once I has started. Billy, whose story the stranger on the train told, was my favourite character. I liked Billy because he was a very brave and heroic soldier who makes a terrible mistake. The reader can really feel how upset Billy is about the terrible decision he made during World War 1.

        <h2 class="r_questions">What did you dislike about this book?</h2>
        <br>
<div class="rbox"><p class="rbox_content">While I really liked The Eagle in the Snow I thought that some of the story was rushed and that such a good story deserved a longer book.</p></div>
        <br>
        <h2 class="r_questions">In summary, who do you think might like this book? Is there a particular age range it’s best suited to? Are there other books or series you think it’s similar to?</h2>
        <br>
        <div class="rbox"><p class="rbox_content">The Eagle in the Snow will appeal to readers who like a really good suspense-filled story and will appeal to readers who like war stories in particular.
    <br>
<h2 class="r_questions">An overall mark out of ten</h2>
        <p class="mark_10">8</p>
