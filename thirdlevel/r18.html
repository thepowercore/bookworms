        <br>
    <div class="rbox"><p class="rbox_content">This is the first book in the Rose series. We meet the main character Rose at the beginning of this book in St. Brigid’s orphanage. She had been left as a baby in a fishbasket in the churchyard and has been living at the orphanage ever since. The girls are taught how to be housemaids at St Brigid’s and Rose looks forward to the day when she becomes a housemaid in a big house.  Miss Bridges arrives one day and takes Rose off to work in Mr Fountain’s house.  He is a magician and Rose notices lots of strange things happening in Mr Fountain’s house. Rose discovers that her friend Maisie has gone missing and lots of other children too.  Rose, Freddie - Mr Fountain’s apprentice, Isabella - Mr Fountain’s spoilt daughter, and Gustavos - Mr Fountain’s cat, uncover the mystery of where the missing children are and who is responsible for their disappearance. They are scared and horrified by what they uncover. Rose also makes some discoveries about herself in this story which she finds frightening at first but is learning to accept by the end of the story.

        <h2 class="r_questions">What did you particularly enjoy about this book?</h2>
        <div class="rbox"><p class="rbox_content">My favourite character is Gustavos, Mr. Fountain’s magical talking cat!  I really enjoyed this book and couldn’t wait to get to the end.</p></div>
        <br>
        <h2 class="r_questions">What did you dislike about this book?</h2>
        <br>
<div class="rbox"><p class="rbox_content">It is easy to care about the main character Rose and I felt sad when the staff were not treating her well.  I felt the ending was a little unfinished but I think that this might be because it leads up to the next mystery.
        <br>
        <h2 class="r_questions">In summary, who do you think might like this book? Is there a particular age range it’s best suited to? Are there other books or series you think it’s similar to?</h2>
        <br>
        <div class="rbox"><p class="rbox_content">I think it is a very good book for solo readers aged 8-10 years.
</p></div>
    <br>
<h2 class="r_questions">An overall mark out of ten</h2>
        <p class="mark_10">10</p>
