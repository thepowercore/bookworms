        <h2 class="r_questions">What is this book about?</h2>
        <br>
    <div class="rbox"><p class="rbox_content">The book is about a boy called Jack and his grandfather. His grandfather was a pilot during World War II.  His grandfather was very old and beginning to forget things and he got lost a few times, so Jack's parents put him into a local nursing home.  
        <br>
The nursing home was horrible with awful nurses and the matron of the home was called Miss Swine! Jack knew he would have to get his grandpa out so they both planned his escape. 
        <br>
Grandpa believed he was still a pilot and always called himself “Wing Commander” and Jack “Squadron Leader”.
Lots of funny adventures happen along the way, as Jack and his Grandpa try to get him and other the other old people out of the nursing home.  
There are lots of funny jokes. I loved reading this book.

        <h2 class="r_questions">What did you particularly enjoy about this book?</h2>
        <div class="rbox"><p class="rbox_content">I love David Walliams' humour and just like all his other books. There are lots of funny bits in this one.
Raj the shopkeeper is in lots of David Walliams' books, as well as this one, I really like him.

        <h2 class="r_questions">What did you dislike about this book?</h2>
        <br>
<div class="rbox"><p class="rbox_content">A little bit long in parts, maybe the book could have been shorter.</p></div>
        <br>
        <h2 class="r_questions">In summary, who do you think might like this book? Is there a particular age range it’s best suited to? Are there other books or series you think it’s similar to?</h2>
        <br>
        <div class="rbox"><p class="rbox_content">I think this book would be best suited to ages 8-12, but we read it out loud and my little brother loved it too and he is 5 so I think it’s a great book for the whole family.
            <br>
It definitely gripped us all and we couldn’t put it down!
